By the time King released 1974's Friends, with the title track and the instrumental \"Philadelphia,\" which sounds like the best of what was produced at Sigma Sound Studios in that era, the mainstream pop audiences were gone, looking more for nostalgia from the Claptons and Steve Millers of the world than forward thinking from \"old\" Blues musicians."

(Miles Davis was attempting much the same with On the Corner in 1972.) When I was a child growing up in the Bronx in a Southern household, King, and Hammond B-3 specialists like the Jimmies — Smith and McGriff, and gospel groups like the Mighty Clouds of Joy and the Soul Stirrers were mainstays. I was gonna hear the blues cause it was my daddy's soundtrack, but hearing King sing songs like \"To Know You,\" \"Friends,\" and \"I Like to Live the Love\" on WBLS, New York City's black-owned radio station, made him relevant to ears that only wanted to listen to The Jackson 5, The Spinners and the Honey Cone. My most intense memories of King's music in that era were his two live recordings with his old friend Bobby \"Blue\" Bland, Together for the First Time (1974) and Together Again (1976), especially tracks like their cover of Bland's classic \"That's the Way Love Is\" and the First Time closer \"I Like to Live the Love\"; Even Jay Z gives a h/t to the latter song on \"Ain't No Love\" (\"take em church\")."

"$text": "King understood, perhaps intuitively, that if it was now his job to claim the Majesty of the Blues, he couldn't make such a claim without the co-sign of black youth, who even then, were arbiters of American cool. King spent much of the last 30 years of his career as the blues's Shaka Zulu, bringing anyone and everybody under the umbrella, often with the kings of rock, like the aforementioned Clapton and even U2 singing his praises. King's most successful recordings, 1997's Deuces Wild -- 17 tracks with 17 different artist ranging from Van Morrison to Heavy D, Bonnie Rait and D'Angelo — and his 2000 collaboration with Clapton, Riding with the King, which went double platinum and earned the duo a Grammy Award, were both examples of how successful King's efforts were. And yet in between those successes, King releases Let The Good Times Roll, a tribute to the music of Louis Jordan, the patron saint of black music's crossover appeal. If King was now the standard bearer of American music, Jordan was his openly acknowledged inspiration."

"$text": "For those who've seen King's concerts over the last decade or so, it's less about the virtuosity that made him matter in his earliest days, and more about the presence of the figure himself. The audiences are some of the most diverse you could expect, though typically more White than anything. The last time I saw King, live at an outdoor jazz festival, he called the children in the audience up to the stage, and handed each one of them one of his signature guitar picks. It was an important gesture towards making sure that even the youngest of folk understand that the Majesty of the Blues wasn't about being above the people, but being among them. Ellington would be proud."

My most intense memories of King's music in that era were his two live recordings with his old friend <a href=\"http://www.npr.org/tags/195137760/bobby-blue-bland\" target=\"_blank\">Bobby \"Blue\" Bland</a>, <em>Together for the First Time</em> (1974) and <em>Together Again</em> (1976), especially tracks like their cover of Bland's classic \"That's the Way Love Is\" and the <em>First Time </em>closer \"I Like to Live the Love\"; Even Jay Z gives a h/t to the latter song on \"Ain't No Love\" (\"take em church\")."

The last time I saw King, live at an outdoor jazz festival, he called the children in the audience up to the stage, and handed each one of them one of his signature guitar picks.

Jeremiah Wright (likely around the same time he met a young Barack Obama) on Wynton Marsalis's 1989 recording <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Majesty_of_the_Blues\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Majesty of the Blues</em></a>. The centerpiece of Crouch's sermon, which challenged perceptions that Jazz was dead, was the singular example of <a href=\"http://www.npr.org/artists/15396582/duke-ellington\" target=\"_blank\">Duke Ellington</a>, who as Crouch asserts, \"never, never came off the road.\" Ellington's genius was as much his ability recognize great musicians who could interpret his vision of the music as it was his understanding that the music would only survive if he and others were willing to take it to the people. Like so many of the musicians of Ellington's generation who understood both the blessing and the curse of the Chitlin' circuit, where black artists survived shoddy treatment for the chance to have a connection with the people for whom the music was so crucial, Ellington also understood, particularly after his groundbreaking performance at the <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNBpMRPfw0A\" target=\"_blank\">Newport Jazz Festival</a> in 1956, that staying on the road was also about delivering the message of \"The Majesty of the Blues,\" which to say the majesty of America's national music.</p>   <p>When Ellington died in May of 1974, he may have bequeathed the responsibility of keeping the music alive to a guitarist from Mississippi who initially made his name in Memphis in the late 1940s as \"Blues Boy\" King. Indeed <a href=\"http://www.npr.org/artists/15402961/b-b-king\" target=\"_blank\">B.B. King</a> appears on a 1970 Ellington album called <em>Stereophonic Duke Ellington</em>, where he contributes vocals to the Ellington classic \"Don't Get Around Much Any More,\"</p>   <p>At the time of Ellington's death, King was the undisputed \"King of the Blues\"&mdash; the most recognizable and accessible icon of a sound that was in flux. As a generation of white British blokes sang the praises of Mr. <a href=\"http://www.npr.org/artists/15201309/muddy-waters\" target=\"_blank\">Waters</a> (who played Newport a few years after Ellington), Mr. Dixon, Mr. <a href=\"http://www.npr.org/artists/15404886/john-lee-hooker\" target=\"_blank\">Hooker</a>, Mr. <a href=\"http://www.npr.org/artists/15406217/howlin-wolf\" target=\"_blank\">Wolf</a>, and Blues artists found both an audience and increased pay days in Europe and touring on the rock circuit, artists like Albert King (\"<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Py37G9qsfY\" target=\"_blank\">Born Under a Bad Sign</a>\") , <a href=\"http://www.npr.org/artists/15403530/little-milton\" target=\"_blank\">Little Milton</a> (\"<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6YAPUnKRzo\" target=\"_blank\">We're Gonna Make It</a>\") and B.B. King found themselves trying to tread the muddy waters of crossover by gravitating to the audiences that Stax, Atlantic and even Motown had cultivated.</p>   <p>With the release \"<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BXsusJ787sU\" target=\"_blank\">The Thrill is Gone</a>\" (1969), B.B. King solidified his role as Black music's ambassador to the world. Throughout the 1970s King also found crossover success with singles like \"Ain't Nobody Home\" (1972) and \"To Know You Is To Love You\" (1973), which was written and originally recorded by <a href=\"http://www.npr.org/artists/15184517/stevie-wonder\" target=\"_blank\">Stevie Wonder</a> and Syretta Wright; Wonder appears on the King version, effectively capturing two generations of black music listeners, at a moment when Wonder was ascending to his own iconic status. By the time King released 1974's <em>Friends</em>, with the title track and the instrumental \"<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aOtSx1DacvE\" target=\"_blank\">Philadelphia</a>,\" which sounds like the best of what was produced at Sigma Sound Studios in that era, the mainstream pop audiences were gone, looking more for nostalgia from the <a href=\"http://www.npr.org/artists/15381813/eric-clapton\" target=\"_blank\">Clapton</a>s and Steve Millers of the world than forward thinking from \"old\" Blues musicians.</p>   <p>King's early- and mid-1970s soul albums, like <em>Friends</em> and <em>To Know You is To Love You,</em> were important, because as young black audiences were running from the blues in droves, it was an attempt to draw them back in. (<a href=\"http://www.npr.org/artists/15368370/miles-davis\" target=\"_blank\">Miles Davis</a> was attempting much the same with <em>On </em><em>the Co</em><em>rner</em><em> </em>in 1972.)

What started amongst a few friends in towns throughout the region has blossomed into a community connecting New Orleans to Nashville to the rest of a nation eager to hear classic music reimagined by young rebels.

As a punk-loving teen growing up in north central Florida, he was turned on by that music's dread and bloody attitude along with its freedom. He moved to New Orleans after college, absorbing the history that's as unavoidable as humidity there. Soon he came up with his own blend, incorporating pretty much every rock and soul-related style a crate-digger would find in a dusty dollar bin at <a href=\"http://www.euclidnola.com/index.jsp\" target=\"_blank\">Euclid Records</a>. Booker's 2014 debut saw him <a href=\"http://www.npr.org/2014/08/10/337769856/first-listen-benjamin-booker-benjamin-booker\" target=\"_blank\">keeping a grip on disorder</a>, as the critic Andy Beta put it, as he pulled all those old styles close to himself and demanded they prove relevant.</p>   <p>Now Booker and the noted video director <a href=\"http://imvdb.com/n/james-lees\">James Lees</a> have made a short film incorporating two songs from that debut — \"Slow Coming\" and \"Wicked Waters\" — and it places his work firmly in the realm of the political. The film, \"The Future is Slow Coming\" is a kind of mash-up of <em>Selma </em>and <em>Beasts of the Southern Wild</em>, with Booker as an unwilling time traveler drawn into an incident of racist violence recalling both the segregated Deep South and current controversial police actions. \"I didn't know how to do a video for this song, honestly,\" Booker explained of \"Slow Coming\" in a recent email interview. \"But James understood what I was trying to say perfectly and was able take that frustration and anger I was feeling and build a visual story around it.\"</p>   <p>Lees explained the film's structure in a separate email. The director is working on a larger project that incorporates magical realism to explore early 20th-century African-American lives in the rural Deep South, and this project refers to that work. He was also thinking of current events. \"Contemporary issues that the video references are repetitions of events we have watched happen many times before,\" Lees wrote. \"We seem unable, as a society, to break this loop. Benjamin gets pulled into the events because ultimately we have to face up to what is happening in front of us and the dangers that may come with it. History shows that real change only comes from those brave enough to make this sacrifice.\"</p>   <p>The cathartic emotions Booker's music invokes, and the witnessing that inspires them, are a crucial element of the current soul/roots scene. Like the version of \"<a href=\"http://www.al.com/entertainment/index.ssf/2013/10/alabama_shakes_new_recording_o.html\" target=\"_blank\">Driva Man</a>\" that the Alabama Shakes recorded for the <em>12 Years a Slave</em> soundtrack or Alynda Lee Segarra's ballad \"<a href=\"http://www.npr.org/blogs/therecord/2014/12/11/370125443/the-political-folk-song-of-the-year\" target=\"_blank\">The Body Electric</a>,\" this film demands that the injustices of the past also be faced when any of us celebrate its pleasures. These are the moments when revivalism becomes something else, something that matters — a connection between a history that remains unresolved and a future that musicians like Booker and his peers are still working to make better.</p>   <p>Booker, currenty on tour in Europe, answered some questions about \"The Future is Slow Coming\" and his music-making process in a recent email exchange.</p>   <div id=\"res392203791\" class=\"bucketwrap video youtube-video large\">  <div class=\"video-wrap\">    <iframe src=\"http://www.youtube.com/embed/1Lfr4JxxCig?rel=0\"></iframe>  </div>  <div class=\"credit-caption externalasset\">      </div></div>   <p><strong>The new video — really a short film — places your songs \"Slow Coming\" and \"Wicked Waters\" within the history of the African-American struggle for civil rights. It's unmistakably evocative of both the events that happened in the South 50 years ago, and recent tragedies, like the killing of Michael Brown in Ferguson. Had you been contemplating ways to address these matters for a while? How did you come upon this way to do it?</strong></p>   <p>The first song, \"Slow Coming\" was written before Eric Garner or Michael Brown were killed, when I first moved to New Orleans in 2012. I was seeing friends fight for gay rights. I was seeing people who immigrated to the States struggle for decent wages and a good education. I was seeing an astounding amount of gun violence and people marching on the streets of Central City for a stop to the crime.</p>   <p>I know the difference between right and wrong and I couldn't understand how these issues I was reading about in books about the 1950s, from people like James Baldwin, could still be unresolved. Of course gay marriage should be legal everywhere. Of course anyone who comes to this country for a better life, who has something to contribute, should be accepted. Of course there is no reason for a black kid growing up in Florida to get a cross burned in his yard or get pulled over nine times in a year for nothing.</p>   <p>The song was written out of that. We've all got iPhones and are talking about taking people to Mars, but look at how much we haven't changed. The \"future,\" a time when all this violence and hatred is looked at as barbaric seemed so far away to me.</p>   <p><strong>Your music blends many different elements and you've been vocal in positioning yourself outside of <a href=\"http://www.salon.com/2015/02/07/benjamin_booker_im_not_a_blues_artist_partner/\" target=\"_blank\">straight-up blues</a>, particularly. You've been creating your own version of the roots music canon by combining gospel, blues, punk and soul in ways that stress the music's rawness and spontaneity. This has allowed you to not get mired in nostalgia. How do you avoid fetishizing the past when you're playing around with classic musical forms? </strong></p>   <p>It wasn't a calculated decision. I was just a music lover who wondered what it would sound like if <a href=\"http://www.npr.org/artists/15802310/otis-redding\" target=\"_blank\">Otis Redding</a> strapped on a guitar and played in a punk band. That's it.</p>   <p><strong>I love the scene in the video where you go into the juke joint. Though juke joints are a kind of cliché commonly used when describing the blues, I think many people don't really know what they were — and are — like. They're not tourist traps; they're for the local community. When you tap into older musical styles, what scenes and communities inspire you?</strong></p>   <p>I'm not looking at the past when I'm writing. I've grown up on gospel and blues music and now it's a huge part of who I am. I try to tap into what's happening in the present and look at what's happening around me. That's what's important to me. But history, my history, seeps into everything I do.</p>   <p><strong>That scene also brings to mind one thing I've learned, studying up on gospel music, especially: Music hasn't simply been a matter of pleasure for African-Americans, it's a survival tool. I think this video powerfully reckons with that, even though the ending is ambiguous. The music is connecting you to the past but also freeing you in some way. I'm wondering how you connect what you do musically with the spirit of self and communal preservation.</strong></p>   <p>Music helped me to get out of a rough period in my life when I really struggled to see any future for myself and was terrified about what was happening to the people around me.</p>   <p>I had a hard time communicating how I felt before playing music and needed to get a lot out. There were conversations I couldn't have with people I know, so I wrote friends and family songs as a way communicate and that's the first record really — an attempt at self and communal preservation.</p>   <p><strong>Your music is also very personal and individualistic. Your lyrics get at sometimes difficult emotional states, and your performance style is very direct. The rawness connects with punk, which I know is a big love of yours. How does punk play into the different way in which you're approaching these older musical styles? Another way to say this is — punk is about the adage \"rip it up and start again,\" but what you're doing rips things up and also preserves them. How do you balance those elements?</strong></p>   <p>Growing up in Florida made this a lot easier for me. Folk-punk artists like <a href=\"http://chrisclavin.bandcamp.com/track/what-i-want-this-bike-is-a-pipe-bomb\" target=\"_blank\">This Bike Is A Pipe Bomb</a> or <a href=\"https://paulbaribeau.bandcamp.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Paul Baribeau</a> were popular in the Florida punk community. I saw people early on combine roots music with more aggressive music.</p>   <p>I guess I balance it out by trying to not give people one genre at the same time. If I play a punk guitar part, I'll sing a gospel melody of the top of it. If I do a blues boogie song I'll throw in some shoegaze or noise elements.</p>   <p><strong>You worked with [producer] Andrija Tokic on the last album, and he's <a href=\"http://www.npr.org/blogs/therecord/2014/07/29/336133410/east-nashville-rocks\" target=\"_blank\">connected to a Nashville scene</a> that's combining Southern musical styles with punk in all kinds of interesting ways.
